1. Description
ARIMA model: using pmdarimaâ€™s auto_arima() function which is a Python & Cython wrapper of several different statistical and machine learning libraries (statsmodels and scikit-learn). The auto-ARIMA process helps to identify the most optimal parameters for an ARIMA model to find a single fitted ARIMA model.

3. Installation
ARIMA model: install pmdarimas package by using pip install $ pip install pmdarima

5. Execution
ARIMA model: Once installed we can import the package and use it on our time series: pmdarima.arima.auto_arima(). More details about the options on setting the auto_arima parameters can be found here https://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/modules/generated/pmdarima.arima.auto_arima.html
